## 1. [HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS]

You will need an ODROID N2 with a hard plastic case. I am using this with a 500gb Samsung Portable SSD, USB3.0, hardline ethernet connection, and SD card. Add a battery back up later on to be sure your ODROID wont lose power during bad weather or some kind of power flux. You will also need a Windows / Linux / Mac with good specs that is on the same network as the ODROID. This setup will take up about as much room as a standard home router/modem and look clean clean once finished.
